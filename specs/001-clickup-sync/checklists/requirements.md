# Specification Quality Checklist: ClickUp Task Sync Extension

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`

### Validation findings (iteration 2 — post mapping-pivot, all pass)

- **No implementation details**: The spec names ClickUp (the integration target, a domain concept the feature is *about*) and refers to the connected ClickUp MCP server only as an external dependency to consume. It avoids file formats, hashing algorithms, exact MCP tool names, JSON schema, and directory paths — reserved for `/speckit-plan`. The manifest and status mapping are described by what they must record, not how they are encoded. PASS.
- **Testable/unambiguous requirements**: Each FR is a single observable behaviour. The pivoted mapping (FR-001 feature=card, FR-002 line=checklist item), idempotence (FR-005/006), derived 3-state status (FR-008), provisioning fail-loud on unusable status set (FR-012), one-way direction (FR-019), and no-secrets (FR-021) are all independently checkable. PASS.
- **Measurable, tech-agnostic success criteria**: SC-001..009 are counts and observable outcomes ("exactly one feature-card", "exactly N checklist items", "zero writes", "provision stops naming needed statuses", "no credentials found"), none citing a framework or API. PASS.
- **Scope bounded**: Out-of-scope is explicit and now backed by a backlog feature — FR-020 defers the full lifecycle, human-testing handoff, and manual mode to `specs/002-clickup-lifecycle/`; the final assumption restates it. PASS.
- **Constitution alignment**: FR-026 + SC-009 + the template-tier assumption assert the Principle III / VIII boundary (extension is spec-workflow scaffolding, not shipped app logic), the key risk for a tracker integration in a template repo. PASS.
- **Clarification markers**: None. The 2026-07-01 clarify session resolved the mapping pivot, the status driver, and the scope split; all are recorded in the spec's Clarifications section. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] remains. PASS.
