Execute the close-out command. The authoritative command body lives at
`.specify/extensions/clickup/commands/speckit.close.md` — read it and follow its steps exactly.

Run when the human is ready to close a verified feature. In order: (1) re-run the check gate
(red → refuse); (2) confirm non-manual tasks complete; (3) surface the remaining manual tasks and
**wait for explicit sign-off** (never auto-check); (4) on sign-off, mark them done in `tasks.md` and
set the `closedOut` marker; (5) final sync so the card reaches `done` (the sync never commits);
(6) commit the close-out edits as a distinct commit (reuse the git-commit module); (7) emit the
closing handoff. The human signs off in the flow, never by editing the tracker.

## Done When

- [ ] The command body was read and followed step by step.
- [ ] Manual tasks were surfaced and only checked after explicit sign-off; the card reached `done`.
- [ ] The close-out edits were committed as a distinct commit; the sync step made no commit.
